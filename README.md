## fluence-task - An activity Web app that promotes sustainability through real life actions


FluenceTask encourages users to shift their daily habits towards tasks that improve sustainability and reduces carbon footprint. Users check in actions on the web app when they perform each task in real life. They also learn about the potential advantages of each action.

## Scalability
Amongst future possibilities: 
Scores from users inputs can be calcuated on hosted service, while users can share their scores achievements
Tokens and Rewards can be given for achievement levels (incentivization)
Estimated summary of reduced carbon Footprint can be reached based on users activity
