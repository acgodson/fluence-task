## fluence-task - An activity Web app that promotes sustainability through real life actions


FluenceTask encourages users to shift their daily habits towards tasks that improve sustainability and reduces carbon footprint at home or work. 

Users connected on the peer check-in actions via the web app when they perform each task in real life. They also learn some potential advantages of each sustainable action.

Active users are displayed on the network and points are awarded for each sustainable action.

This idea leverages on the userList-inmemory service already deployed on a fluence node from the Fluence-JS template at https://github.com/fluencelabs/fluent-pad.git

React frontend is used to demonstrate this potential use of fluence for a sustainable project.


## Possibilities and Scalability of FluenceTask
Amongst Other possibilities on FluenceTask: 
UserList Service can be deployed on a seperate fluence node from the template.
Scores from users inputs can be calcuated using a service for calculation, and tokenized rewards can be given to participants for different levels of success (incentivization)
Estimated summary of optimized carbon Footprint can also be predicated based on each user's activity
