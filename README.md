## fluence-task - An activity Web app that promotes sustainability through real life actions


FluenceTask encourages users to shift their daily habits towards tasks that improve sustainability and optimizes carbon footprint, at home or workplace. Users connected on the peer network check-in actions when they perform each task in real life. They also learn some potential advantages of each sustainable action.

User-list is displayed and points are awarded for each sustainable action. 

## Hosted Service
This idea leverages on the userList-inmemory service already hosted on a fluence node from the Fluence-JS template at https://github.com/fluencelabs/fluent-pad.git

## Browser Framework
React frontend is used to demonstrate this potential use of fluence for a sustainable project.
